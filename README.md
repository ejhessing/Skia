things that I need to check work well with React Skia

- Can put an image on the canvas (done)
- Can draw over the image (done)
- Can I place a marker on an image ()
- Can I interact with that marker, have a popover on the marker ()
- Can I have a popover on the marker that has a button that can be clicked ()
